# Installation

Everything you need to set up to use Agents Kit.

## What is Agents Kit?

Agents Kit is a collection of components and utilities that help you build chat interfaces. It is designed to be flexible and easy to use, so you can focus on building your AI / chat experience.

Agents Kit is not a component library to be installed via npm, but rather a set of components that you can copy and paste into your project.

## Dependencies

Agents Kit depents on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). So you need to setup shadcn/ui first. <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation" target="_blank">https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation</a>


If you are already using shadcn/ui, you can start using Agents Kit right away.


## Where to start?

First, take a look at the components and blocks. If you find one you like, feel free to copy and paste it into your project and give it a try.
